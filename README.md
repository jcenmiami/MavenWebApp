Using Eclipse with Maven installed, create a servlet that displays how many times a  page has been accessed. 
A counter is initialized to zero as a field (instance variable  in a class) and it is incremented in the  
doGet or doPost method and displayed on the  page. 
Each time the servlet it is run the counter will be initialize d to zero. 
So it only  updates when you refresh the page. Use the Jetty server. 
Your output should look similar to this.
